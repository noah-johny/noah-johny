# ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m **Noah Johny**
## A self-taught Fullstack Developer & Product Designer

As a seasoned developer with a creative flair, I specialize in crafting efficient software solutions ðŸš€. Proficient in **Java, Python, and C**, my hands-on expertise is centered on **JavaScript and TypeScript**. In web development, I skillfully leverage **React, Next.js, and the MERN Stack**, complemented by adept use of **React Native and Expo** for cross-platform app development.

Beyond coding, I navigate the design realm ðŸŽ¨ at the intersection of aesthetics and functionality. **Figma** serves as my design playground and this dual proficiency in development and design positions me to craft seamless, end-to-end digital experiences.

**Whether itâ€™s pixels or code, Iâ€™m all in.** Letâ€™s create something remarkable! ðŸŒŸ
