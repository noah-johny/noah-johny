# ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m **Noah Johny**
## A self-taught Fullstack Developer & Product Designer

As a seasoned developer with a creative flair, I specialize in crafting efficient software solutions ðŸš€. Proficient in **Java, Python, and C**, my hands-on expertise is centered on **JavaScript and TypeScript**. In web development, I skillfully leverage **React, Next.js, and the MERN Stack**, complemented by adept use of **React Native and Expo** for cross-platform app development.

Beyond coding, I navigate the design realm ðŸŽ¨ at the intersection of aesthetics and functionality. **Figma** serves as my design playground, where I sculpt visually stunning and user-centric interfaces. This dual proficiency in development and design positions me to craft seamless, end-to-end digital experiences.

Currently in the final year of my **B.Tech ðŸŽ“ in Computer Science and Engineering at Christ College of Engineering**, Kerala, my academic journey intertwines with a rich tapestry of projects and collaborative endeavours within cross-functional teams. Actively engaged in diverse campus clubs and activities, I bring a holistic perspective to my work. With a portfolio of internships, I am adept at applying my skills to real-world scenarios, making a meaningful impact in every endeavour.

**Whether itâ€™s pixels or code, Iâ€™m all in.** Letâ€™s create something remarkable! ðŸŒŸ
